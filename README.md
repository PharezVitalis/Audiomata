# Audiomata
A Unity developer tool that automates much of the Audio system in unity to allow various combinations of effects, filters and tracks in a procedural like manner

The system should allow:
- Events that can change or play tracks
- Events that apply audio filters such as high pass or band pass e.g. These must be applied to any designated channel
- A system that can combine samples into tracks using controlled randomisation whereby some combinations can be made disallowed
- A robust UI that allows these systems to be managed from one place.
- Events that change individual audio sources 
- The ability to revert back to the raw audio signals
- The ability to use Unity Audio Snapshots in order to apply effects to channels
- The ability to tag audio tracks and use tags with Boolean operators to call upone trakcs with the event system


Stretch goals:
- A system that allows players to import thier own audio into the game
- Create a Unity Asset that packages this system
-
